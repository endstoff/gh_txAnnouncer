# Ghostscripts txAnnouncer

Since I couldn't locate any [txAdmin](https://txadm.in) announcements on the forums, I opted to craft this straightforward one. Within the *shared.lua* file, you have the freedom to customize the notification to your preference. Should you wish to alter the language, you'll need to access the *server.lua* file.

You can find the Notification I used here: [t-notify](https://github.com/TasoOneAsia/t-notify)
